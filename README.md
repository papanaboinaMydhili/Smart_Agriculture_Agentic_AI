# 🌱 Smart Agriculture Agentic AI

Smart Agriculture Agentic AI is an intelligent farming support system built using **Agentic AI, Machine Learning, and Conversational AI**.  
The system assists users by recommending suitable crops and providing irrigation guidance based on soil and environmental conditions.

## 📌 Project Overview
Agriculture depends on multiple factors such as soil nutrients, weather, and water availability.  
This project uses Artificial Intelligence to analyze these factors and provide meaningful recommendations to support better agricultural decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To recommend appropriate crops using Machine Learning  
- To provide irrigation suggestions using autonomous decision logic  
- To demonstrate the practical application of Agentic AI  
- To build a conversational AI interface for easy interaction  

## 🧠 Agentic AI Concept
In this project, the AI system behaves as an **agent** that:
- Understands user queries
- Analyzes sensor-like data (simulated)
- Takes independent decisions without manual rules

This makes the system autonomous and intelligent.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Conversational AI interaction
- Crop recommendation using Machine Learning
- Simulated IoT-based soil and weather data
- Autonomous decision-making using Agentic AI
- REST API built using Flask

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas and NumPy
- Joblib
- VS Code
- GitHub

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- Soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)
- Environmental parameters (Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall)
- Soil pH value
- Crop label for prediction

The dataset is used to train a Machine Learning model for crop recommendation.

## 🌍 Application Areas
- Smart Farming Systems
- Precision Agriculture
- Agricultural Decision Support
- AI-based Farming Assistants

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project highlights how **Agentic AI combined with Machine Learning and Conversational AI** can be effectively used to solve real-world agricultural challenges and improve farming productivity.
